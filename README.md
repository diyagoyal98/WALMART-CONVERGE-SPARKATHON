# THEME :- FUTURE OF RETAIL

# OUR IDEA :- 
Introducing our comprehensive chatbot designed to cater to the needs of customers, merchants, and employees all in a single platform. Seamlessly handling a wide array of general and shopping-related inquiries, this chatbot is your one-stop solution for efficient and effective support.


# MAIN PROBLEM THAT WE WERE SOLVING :- 
In today's e-commerce era, mobile shopping is predominant. Customers seek help for products, apps, and info, akin to offline shopping. Employees lack a central resource, hindering assistance. Merchants connecting with domains like Walmart face lengthy onboarding and lack centralized forecasting for future needs.


# HOW WE WERE TRYING TO SOLVE :- 
Our Chatbot offers personalized experiences, quickly meeting user needs. Segmented for Customers, Employees, and Merchants, it provides catalog access, product info, sales, payments, and recommendations, easing tasks effectively in the least possible time. 
Tech Stack:
Dialogflow for dialogue generation and getting sentiment for the chatbot.
Python as the backend for API generation to communicate to Dialogflow.
Mongo DB as our database
React js for the front end.
